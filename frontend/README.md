```

## now.sh and cloudflare

see [this](https://zeit.co/docs/v1/guides/how-to-use-cloudflare) for more info.  
now.sh doesn't work currently because we need an ssr config. instead I'm using heroku (or you can use gcp)

## heroku

deploy to heroku using the script. see [this](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205893698-Configure-Cloudflare-and-Heroku-over-HTTPS) for connecting to cloudflare. also look at [this](https://nuxtjs.org/faq/heroku-deployment/) first.

## netlify

just make a cname pointing to netlify domain name and set ssl to flexible in cloudflare. add custom domain for api and set dns from google following [this](https://medium.com/@matryer/cloud-hack-how-to-get-production-ready-free-static-website-hosting-cbc2d25c5771).
