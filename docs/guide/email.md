# getting email working

After trying to get mailinabox, postfix, and others working on a gcp server, essentially creating my own mail server, I realized that it wouldn't work and looked for alternatives. Thankfully I found this - [improvmx](https://improvmx.com/), which forwards emails to your favorite email client (gmail). To send emails from your domain, you need to follow [these instructions](https://improvmx.com/guides/send-emails-using-gmail/). It's really easy and it just works. That's why I'm sticking with it.
